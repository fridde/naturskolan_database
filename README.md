# Naturskolan Database
A database system for Naturskolan

This is a database and frontend system to simplify the recurring booking tasks done by a "Naturskola" (nature school) that involve contact with the accompanying teachers, automated html-mails and sms-reminders.  

The project has reached production stage and is under active development.

Currently runs on a LAMP stack using PHP 7.2 and MariaDB.
